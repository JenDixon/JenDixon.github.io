It was a dark and stormy night ... literally. NJ was a rainy mess, and I was sitting at my computer looking at a blank page and trying to fill it with some ideas for the CLI data gems project. Maybe "The Best Restaurants near Teaneck NJ" or "The New England Patriots 2016 schedule" could work. I decided to go with "Medium Tech Feed" or "Medium Well" as I named it as very few people would care about Teaneck restaurants and the NE Patriots tend to bring out the haters and I'm not up for a debate about my boyfried Tom Brady. 

After that deciding how to display the information and what options to give was relatively easy to figure out. List out the tech posts sorted by recency or recommendation and allow the user to pick one to read. I still had no code though, so I decided to follow the CLI coding video and use the instructor's process for building his CLI, at least as a start. That seemed simple enough. Only there was a problem, his workflow didn't work for me at all. As a matter of fact it kind of confused me. Not because it was terrible or he didn't explain things well, my brain just doesn't work that way so my coding style is different. 

I found that once I only used the video for reference every now and then, and actually started drawing a chart of my classes and how they'd interact, then coding them, things went relatively quickly. I definitely learned how to code a scraper, more importantly, I learned more about my thought and coding process.
